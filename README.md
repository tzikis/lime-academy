## Tasks

### Intro to Blockchain

#### What is a transaction?

A transaction is a call to the distributed ledger that results in a change to the state of the ledger.

#### What is the approximate time of every Ethereum transaction?

It depends on a number of factors, mostly network congestion and gas fees you are willing to pay to incentivize miners to prioritize your transaction. With a standard fee, it should generally take a few seconds to a few minutes.

#### What is a node?

A node is one computer running the Ethereum software, receives and broadcasts changes to the ledger, tries to compute the next block, and generally takes part in the consensus process.
